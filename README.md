Minecraft But Sh*t
A questionable recreation of Minecraft. Emphasis on "questionable."
This is my attempt at making Minecraft in Unity with C#. It's called "But Sh*t" because, well... it's pretty Sh*t.

AI (Claude) was used during the process.

Features:
- Procedural terrain generation with Perlin noise
- Block breaking system (with a cracking animations which is not used)
- First-person movement and camera controls
- Different block types (grass, dirt, stone, sand, water)
- Trees
- Day/night cycle
- Water blocks with animation
- A torch you can hold
- Crosshair (was made by Viktor Bergstrøm Hansen)

Future work:
- Block placing (ran out of time)
- Inventory system
- particals

Controls
- WASD - Move around
- Mouse - Look around
- Space - Jump
- Left Click - Break blocks
- Shift - Walk slowly
- (R) Restart game
- Escape - Unlock cursor
